# Hand_Cricket
This is the virtual version of game "HAND CRICKET", where you are batting and computer wants to send you back to pavillion.
You will choose a number between 1 and 6, if computer also generates the same number, you will be out, and total score will be displayed on the screen. This game continues till you want to play.
For the sound effect, all you have to do is change the directory address in code and put the address where the ipl.mp3 file is stored.
You can ask your friends to have a small competition if luck with you. Enjoy!!
